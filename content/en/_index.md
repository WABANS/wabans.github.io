Welcome to the Wabans documentation.
Here you can find the latest information on the Wabans Player.

## What is the Wabans Player?
The Wabans Player is an open source digital audio player (DAP) that currently doesn't exist.
We plan to develop the player and share the development process on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@wabans) and here on this website in the form of blog posts.
If your interested in the process and where we are currently standing check out the [roadmap](/roadmap/).
And if you would like to know what the Wabans Player encompasses check out the [features](/features/) that we plan to implement.
