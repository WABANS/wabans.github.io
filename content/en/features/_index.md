This is the main page for all the features that are already listed.
Meaning that they are categorised into three different catogories:
- _Important_ : The feature will be implemented in stages one to three (the stages are explained in the [roadmap](/roadmap/)).
- _Nice to have_ : Referes to implementations planned for stage four.
- _Rejected_ : We have considered the feature but will not implement it.

The features are separated into two pages:
- [Hardware](/features/hardware.md/)
- [Software](/features/software.md/)
